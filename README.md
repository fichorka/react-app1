This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), it uses MobX for state managment and Tachyons classes for design.

Once I initialized React app, i ran `npm eject` script in order enable MobX decorators.

## To install dependencies, run: `npm install`

## 2. To start the app, run: `npm start`
